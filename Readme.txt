MN - How To Use C-Sharp and IL-Compiler
---------------------------------------

These examples show how an IL or a c-sharp file can be compiled to a temporary exe,
then it will be started and afterwards the temporary exe can be deleted.

It also contains an example, how c-sharp code can be embedded into powershell to run it.

To test these examples, just run each of the following files:

  HelloWorld*.bat
  HelloWorld*.ps1


Examples:

- HelloWorld1 : Example C-Sharp file which can be compiled and run ad-hoc.

- HelloWorld2 : Example IL file which can be compiled and run ad-hoc.

- HelloWorld3 : Example PS file how a C-Sharp source code can be embedded in powershell script to be run.
